					<h1>Oschin Planetarium</h1>
 						<p>With its spectacular Zeiss star projector, digital projection system, state-of-the-art aluminum dome, comfy seats, sound system, and theatrical lighting, the 290-seat Samuel Oschin Planetarium theater is the finest planetarium in the world.</p>

Stunning full-dome video transports us back in time, from the Library of Alexandria, to Galileo’s courtyard, to the world’s most powerful telescopes in a quest for answers among the stars. Travel through time and space back to the big bang and through a universe filled with galaxies to find our cosmic origins and discover our true place in the cosmos.</p>

If we find water on other worlds in the solar system, could we find life there, too? Blast off to Mars, crash through the ice of Jupiter’s moon Europa, and travel alongside a comet in a search for habitable worlds beyond Earth. Originally conceived and developed for Griffith Observatory’s school field trip program, Water is Life is an ideal family program that will appeal to even our youngest visitors.</p>

The Vikings believed the northern lights were valkyries, warrior spirits who descended from heaven to take fallen heroes from the battlefield to Valhalla, the palace of the gods. Explore the source of the northern lights (the Sun), in a cosmic light show set to one of the most iconic pieces of music of all time, Wagner's "Ride of the Valkyries."</p>

						<h4>Event Horizon Theater</h4>
						<p>The 190-seat Leonard Nimoy Event Horizon presentation theater dramatically expands the Observatory's programming and education capabilities. The Leonard Nimoy Event Horizon realizes an unfulfilled intention of the Observatory's original architects to have a second theater to complement the planetarium. Though not constructed with the original building, the idea for a presentation theater was not lost, and the need became especially evident as the number of Observatory visitors and programs increased over the years.</p>
						<p>The public presentation - "The Once and Future Griffith Observatory" - is a 24-minute film which weaves the history, recent renovation, and future of the Observatory into a tale of observation and inspiration. The theater also hosts live programs and demonstrations including All Space Considered and Let's Make a Comet. The Leonard Nimoy Event Horizon is also a classroom for the Observatory's school programs.</p>

						<h4>Now Showing...</h4>
						<h5>The Once and Future Griffith Observatory</h5>
						<p class="summary">An exciting and compelling introduction to the history and unique public offerings of the Observatory. This 24-minute film, entertainingly narrated by Leonard Nimoy, reveals how the vision of one man led to the creation of an architectural, cultural, and astronomical icon for southern California.</p>
						<p class="summary">Shown every hour, on the hour.</p>
						<h5>All Space Considered</h5>
						<p class="summary">An inside look at the most talked-about subjects in astronomy, space science, and space exploration. Observatory curatorial staff and special guests bring visitors up to date on what is going on in space.</p>
						<p class="summary">First Friday of each month, 7:30p - 9:45p</p>
